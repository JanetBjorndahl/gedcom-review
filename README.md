GEDCOM review
=============

This project provides functionality for people to review their GEDCOMs prior to their being imported into WeRelate.org.

The project is based upon (an old version of) Adobe Flex.  To build it, you will need to 
* download flex 3 from http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/entitlement/index.cfm?e=flex3sdk and install it
* create a build.properties file with FLEX\_HOME set to the location in which you installed flex
* run `ant build`
